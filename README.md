 Hi, I’m Nishith Thakkar (@nishit-thakkar007)
👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, AI-driven Analytics, and Cloud-based Data Engineering.
 I’m currently learning advanced Business & Data Analytics, scalable ML pipelines, and cloud analytics using AWS, Spark, and Databricks.
 I’m looking to collaborate on Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, NLP, and end-to-end analytics projects—especially in FinTech and business analytics domains.
